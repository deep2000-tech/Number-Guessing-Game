# Number Guessing Game in Python

## Project Overview
This is a simple **Number Guessing Game** built using Python.  
The program randomly selects a number, and the user has to guess it within a certain number of attempts.  
After each guess, the program provides feedback — whether the guessed number is **too high**, **too low**, or **correct**.

This project helps beginners understand:
- The use of **loops**
- **Conditional statements (if-else)**
- **Random number generation**
- Basic **input/output handling**

## Features
- Random number generation using Python’s `random` module.  
- Customizable number range.  
- Hints after each incorrect guess.  
- Option to play again after finishing one round.
